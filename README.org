* ORG
Org is a cli tool to parse your org files for todo's. This tool is inspired by
[[https://taskwarrior.org/][Taskwarrior]].

** Motivation
I love the idea behind Taskwarrior, but I use org-mode to handle all my
documentation and todo needs. As I was learning Go I was looking for a project
to put it all in practice.

** Features
** Todo's [0/4]
- [ ] Pretty print the results
- [ ] Parse schedules and deadlines
- [ ] Mark items as done
- [ ] Create new items
